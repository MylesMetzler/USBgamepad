# USBgamepad
A USB gamepad sketch for a mame cabinet I built.

Uses a [Atmega32u4 Breakout Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/296) loaded with Arduino leonardo firmware.

4x16 switch matrix enumerates as 2 gamepads (I could not get 4 to work under windows).

I don't remember which sketch I am actually using.  Motherboards that supply power to USB ports even when the system is down will cause problems with this sketch (and other devices...).
